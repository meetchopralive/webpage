# What's Up! I'm Meet Chopra | The Aspiring Full-Stack Guy

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio repository, which is basically the digital sandbox where I dump all the cool stuff I'm building as a BCA student.

My mission? To build web apps that are clean, lightning-fast, and easy to maintain. I'm a stickler for great user experience, so if it's slow or clunky, I'm already mad at it. Come along for the journey as I grind my way through full-stack development!

## My Current Gear (Tech Stack & Skills)

I'm constantly learning and expanding my toolkit, but here's what I'm rocking right now:

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React. Focus: Making things look awesome, keeping load times snappy, and building intuitive UIs.
- Backend: Node.js, C. Focus: Developing solid APIs and diving into low-level systems programming (yeah, I like C!).
- Tools & Workflow: Git, GitHub, VS Code. Focus: Version control is a must, deploying on GitHub Pages, and generally writing good code.
- Learning Next: Basic AI Concepts, MongoDB. Focus: Getting deep into the MERN Stack (that full-stack dream!) and tackling more advanced C challenges.

## Stuff I've Built (Featured Projects)

These are my go-to examples for showing what I can actually do. Head over to my portfolio site for live demos!

### 1. Simple Calculator (C Backend + HTML/JS UI)
This wasn't just a calculator; it was an experiment! I integrated the core math logic using C and wrapped it with a web UI.
* Why? To see how system logic connects with the web world—pretty cool stuff for performance geeks.

### 2. To-do App (JavaScript/Local Storage)
The classic starter project, but done right. It's focused on handling data entirely within the browser.
* Why? Essential for mastering DOM manipulation and making sure data sticks around (client-side persistence).

### 3. Personal Portfolio (You're looking at the repo for this one!)
I built this site from the ground up, keeping speed and a clean, minimalist design front and center.
* Why? To prove I can build an efficient, professional site using simple, effective tools like Tailwind CSS.

## Real-World Check (Experience Snapshot)

I'm all about learning by doing. Here's where I've put in the hours:

* Intern / Project Work (2024): Jumped into smaller web projects, helping out with new features, maintaining code, and trying to keep the codebase clean and documented.
* Cyber Cafe Internship (2024): This taught me the real fundamentals: managing computer systems, keeping the network alive, and how to actually secure and move data safely. Valuable knowledge!

## What I'm Thinking About (Blog)

I write about my journey, the technical hurdles I face, and general developer life.

* Why Portfolios Get Copied
* Contributing Less to Open-Source
* The Future of MERN Stack (Coming Soon)

## Let's Connect!

I'm hungry for an internship right now—I want a chance to join a team and make a real impact. If you're building something cool, let's talk!
